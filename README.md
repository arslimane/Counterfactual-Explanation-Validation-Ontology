# Counterfactual Explanation Generation for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting  

This repository accompanies our research paper, which addresses the challenge of explainability in deep learning models, particularly in the context of multivariate time series forecasting.  

## üîç **Overview**  
Deep learning models excel at predicting complex patterns in multivariate time series, making them invaluable in critical domains such as healthcare and finance. However, their "black-box" nature raises concerns about trust and interpretability. To address this, we propose two novel methods for generating counterfactual explanations:  
1. **GENO-TOPSIS**: Combines Genetic Algorithms with the TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making approach.  
2. **NSGA-II**: A faster alternative that achieves comparable results.  

To ensure these explanations are valid within domain-specific constraints, we introduce:  
- **CEVO**: The Counterfactual Explanation Validation Ontology.  
- CEVO leverages SWRL rules and SPARQL queries for validation.  

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study on estimating the State of Charge (SoC) of LFP battery cells.
